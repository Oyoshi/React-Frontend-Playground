# Project 3 - Simple Forex App

## Purpose

Combine design system with external API and d3js charts library to visualize currencies data.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Use [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) as ready design system
- Use [Franfurter](https://www.frankfurter.app/) as an external API for currencies
- Use [d3js](https://d3js.org/) for data visualization

## Potential Improvements

- Probably use something different for plotting, **d3js** is too low level
